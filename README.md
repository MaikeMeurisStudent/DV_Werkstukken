# THIS IS A GLIMPSE OF HUMANITY.


## Assignment 1 - THE HISTORY OF US

  The Most Influential People In History (According To Wikipedia)
  EXPLORATORY – INTERACTIVE – D3
  
  A web application that shows a world map with a slider underneath. Each point on the slide corresponds
  with a century. If the slider gets changed, de world map adjusts itself with the information for that
  century. The map shows people from that century which are found in the top 1000 “most influential
  people” according to Wikipedia.
  
  It is interesting to evaluate the data on the map. For example, you can see in which century America
  for discovered.
  
  
## Assignment 2 - THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

  Average annual precipitation of the different continents
  EXPLORATORY – PHYSICAL – INTERACTIVE – 3D
  
  A physical installation showing the average precipitation per continent in 2011.

  It’s the intention that the “user” of the visualisation gets a world map in front of him. On this map,
  each continent has a hole in it, where the user can go into with his fingers. Underneath the hole, there’s
  a cup that contains water, in which the amount of water corresponds with the amount of precipitation
  of that continent.

  To show the user the actual data and confirm his possible suspicions, the precipitation data per
  continent can be read on top of the box, underneath moving cards.

  To make the whole even more interactive, the user can also use a measuring stick to read the depths
  of the cups and make an estimate of the amount of precipitation for that continent.
  
  
## Assignment 3 - THE AIR WE BREATHE

  Oxygen levels in the air
  EXPLANATORY – LINEAR – NODE-BASED
  
  A video that shows how the amount of oxygen goes down the higher you go up.


## Assignment 4 - THE INTERESTS WE SHARE

  ‘Friends jam’: What music do your friends listen to?
  EXPLANATORY & EXPLORATORY – INTERACTIVE
  
  A web application that is connected to your Spotify account and shows your friend’s taste in music. On
  the right, there is a chart showing the percentage of your friends that listen to the music genres that
  are shown. In the middle, there are a number of music notes. Each music note represents one of your
  friends. The music note corresponds with one of the music genres. When you hover over a music note,
  you get to see more info like your friend’s name, their favourite song in their most listened to genre,
  and the name of the genre. When you click on a note, the corresponding song begins to play.
  
  
## Assignment 5 - THE DEATH OF US

  Decreasing Arctic Sea Ice Volume
  EXPLANATORY – STATIC
  
  A poster showing in 2 ways the decreasing arctic sea ice volume.

  Above the water, multiple icebergs are shown. Each iceberg shows the average volume over ten years. The years with which it   corresponds are shown next to the iceberg.

  Underneath the water, there is a chart that shows the actual values of each September month over a
  period of 40 years. Sometimes the volume increases a bit again, but if you look at the whole picture,
  you can see the ice volume has decreased significantly between 1979 and 2018.
